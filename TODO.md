## üéØ Implementation Strategy Recommendations

### Phase 1: Core Data Pipeline (Week 1-2) - ‚úÖ **50% COMPLETE**
1. ‚úÖ **`jobs_scraper.py` COMPLETED** - Entry point implemented with live API
2. ‚úÖ **Database schema READY** - SQLModel classes defined in database.py
3. üîÑ **Set up `contacts.py` with caching** - Next priority (HIGH)
4. üîÑ **Create end-to-end test with mock data** - After contacts.py integration

### Phase 2: AI & Matching (Week 3-4)  
1. **Implement `drive_ingest.py`** - Build the candidate database
2. **Create `vector_matcher.py`** - Core matching algorithm
3. **Integrate GPT-4o for re-ranking** - Quality scoring system
4. **Test with real r√©sum√© data** - Validate match quality

### Phase 3: Message Generation (Week 5)
1. **Implement `messaging.py`** - Jeremy Toh's style template
2. **Add all validation constraints** - Character limits, dash rules
3. **Test message variants** - Avoid LinkedIn duplication flags
4. **Integrate Claude-3 Haiku** - Cost-effective message generation

### Phase 4: Output & Scheduling (Week 6)
1. **Implement `sheet_writer.py`** - Google Sheets integration
2. **Set up `scheduler.py`** - APScheduler with MYT timezone  
3. **Complete `main.py`** - FastAPI endpoints and webhook
4. **Deploy to Railway** - Production environment setup

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Design Decisions Needed

### 1. Database Schema Design
- **Question**: How to structure job requirements extraction and storage?
- **Recommendation**: Create separate `job_requirements` table with many-to-many relationship
- **Impact**: Affects matching algorithm performance and accuracy

### 2. Embedding Strategy  
- **Question**: Which embedding model and dimension size?
- **Recommendation**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions) for cost efficiency
- **Impact**: Storage costs vs. matching quality trade-off

### 3. Caching Strategy
- **Question**: Redis vs. Postgres for decision-maker caching?
- **Recommendation**: Use Postgres for simplicity, Redis if performance becomes issue
- **Impact**: Infrastructure complexity vs. response time

### 4. Rate Limiting Approach
- **Question**: Global rate limiter vs. per-endpoint limits?
- **Recommendation**: Per-API rate limiting with exponential backoff
- **Impact**: API costs and reliability

## üîç Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Current: Mocked)
- [ ] Convert mocks to integration tests with test database
- [ ] Add property-based testing for message validation
- [ ] Create load tests for batch operations

### Integration Tests  
- [ ] End-to-end pipeline test with staging environment
- [ ] Google Drive webhook testing with test folder
- [ ] Rate limiting behavior validation

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Database query optimization testing
- [ ] Vector search performance benchmarking  
- [ ] Memory usage profiling for large batch operations

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### API Dependencies
- **Risk**: RapidAPI rate limits or service outages
- **Mitigation**: Implement circuit breaker pattern, fallback strategies

### Data Quality
- **Risk**: Poor job posting or r√©sum√© data quality
- **Mitigation**: Add data validation layers, quality scoring

### Cost Control  
- **Risk**: Unexpected API charges from OpenAI/Claude
- **Mitigation**: Monthly budget alerts, usage monitoring dashboard

### Compliance
- **Risk**: LinkedIn ToS violations, data privacy issues
- **Mitigation**: Legal review of scraping approach, GDPR compliance audit

## üéØ Recommended Next Command

```bash
# jobs_scraper.py is COMPLETE! Next: implement contacts.py with decision maker caching
code src/contacts.py
```

**Priority**: Implement `contacts.py` with 30-day caching mechanism to avoid unnecessary API costs. This will complete the core data pipeline foundation.
